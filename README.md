# 3D-models
3D models that I have collected and 3D-printed. For Fun!

These models were printed in NUS Makers@SoC using the MakerBot Sketch Standard 3D Printer, using PLA filament. You can follow this [guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MjB02AxNMWdxNW8kp-tIVLkfuIsDS7bRRvLHvy5xwCM/edit#slide=id.p) to print.
